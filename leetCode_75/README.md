# 🧩 LeetCode 75 Solutions 🔍

Welcome to my personal repository for the **LeetCode 75** challenge!

I’m learning DSA step by step, solving problems from the challenge based on the topics I’m studying (e.g., Arrays & Strings, Two Pointers, etc.). I'm not following a strict day or level-based structure.

## 📚 Why This Repo?
- Track my DSA progress
- Practice consistency
- Share solutions (even if they’re imperfect)

This is a **work in progress**, and so am I 🙂  
You may find some grammatical errors or beginner-level explanations — that’s part of the learning process!

## 🏗️ Structure
Problems are grouped by category (like LeetCode 75 does):
- Arrays & Strings
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Dynamic Programming
... and more!

Each solution file is named after the problem for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- C++ 💻
- Git & GitHub 💻

## 🚧 Still Learning...
